Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Thai Receipt

# Overview
The purpose of the project is to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system specifically tailored for Thai receipts. Optical Character Recognition involves the conversion of images or scanned documents into machine-encoded text, enabling automated data extraction. In the context of Thai receipts, this project aims to create a solution that accurately and efficiently extracts text information, such as transaction details, vendor names, and amounts, from the often complex and varied layout of Thai receipts.
